# 🚀 JetBrains Academy – Projects Converted to C#

This repository contains selected projects from my JetBrains Academy learning tracks (Python and Java) reimplemented in **C#**.  
The goal is to deepen my understanding of the language and showcase clean, idiomatic C# solutions.

> 🧠 These are not simple line-by-line translations — each project is carefully restructured to follow best practices in C#, including proper use of types, properties, LINQ, OOP principles, and .NET conventions.

---

## 🧩 Why Convert?

By reimplementing projects from other languages into C#, I aim to:

- Demonstrate cross-language fluency and problem-solving skills.
- Reinforce my C# fundamentals and explore advanced features.
- Create a cohesive, idiomatic C# portfolio using real-world challenges.

Each project includes a README detailing:
- Original source (Python or Java)
- Concepts covered
- Adaptations made for the C# version

## ✅ Converted Projects

- **[CornerShopCalculator](./CornerShopCalculator)** – basic earnings vs expenses calculator.

> More projects coming soon — including selected Java track challenges.

---

## 📦 Structure

Each project lives in its own directory with:
- A full Visual Studio solution (`.sln`) or standalone project
- Clear and commented C# code
- A dedicated README explaining the conversion

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: C# 12
- **Runtime**: .NET 8
- **IDE**: Visual Studio / Rider / VSCode (with C# Dev Kit)
- **Paradigms**: OOP, functional elements via LINQ, pattern matching

## 🧠 About the Original Tracks

The projects come from the [JetBrains Academy (Hyperskill)](https://hyperskill.org/tracks) platform, as part of:

- **Python Developer Track**
- **Java Backend Developer Track**

## 📌 Note

This repo is not affiliated with JetBrains or Hyperskill — all projects were completed independently as part of my studies and restructured for learning purposes.
